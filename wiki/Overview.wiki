#summary overview of the project

= The problem =
Given a perfectly arranged lattice, figuring out the bonds that connect the atoms is a trivial problem. For a non-perfect structure, the solution is not obvious and can be viewed as an energy optimization problem

= Verifying the methods =
In order to verify that the methods we employ are even possible of generating reasonable solutions, we apply them to trivial lattices. Examples of such trial cases are a square lattice or 2D honeycomb (think graphene).

= Random Lattices =
Though not based on a specific physical situation, the random arrangement below provides a good test bed for the optimization algorithms as it is a difficult problem to solve.
