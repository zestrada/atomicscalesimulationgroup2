All optimization methods were tested on their ability to fold four different lattice
= Introduction =

The goal of this project is to test various optimization methods on their ability to reconstruct a surface.  We modeled 2-D surfaces using a simple harmonic energy function and generated fully connected graphs to represent the bond connectivity one could expect from the lattices.

All optimization methods were tested on their ability to fold four different lattices: hexagonal. square, sheared hexagonal, and randomly displaced square lattices.  

All calculations were conducted in Java 1.6 while analyzes and input generation were handled with Awk, Python, TCL, and other languages.
