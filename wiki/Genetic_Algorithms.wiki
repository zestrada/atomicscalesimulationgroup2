= Generation Rules =


•  Selection - Fitness proportionate/roulette-wheel selection:
    -  Area of the wheel assigned to each parent in proportion to fitness
•  Crossover - Matrix Crossover Variant:
    -  Select a column M at random and interchange column data between parents
    -  After interchange, Vk > V0 for any particle, disconnect from farthest neighbor
•  Mutation - 2-Opt Operator Variant:
    -  Connect all particles between two randomly chosen points i1 and i2 with a randomly chosen neighbor
    -  After interchange, Vk > V0 for any particle, disconnect from farthest neighbor

= Observations =

*  Crossover leads the algorithm towards global minima

*  Mutation pulls the algorithm out of local minima traps

*  Speed and convergence depend strongly on initial populations and mutation parameter
