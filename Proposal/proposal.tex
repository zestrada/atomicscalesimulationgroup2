\textbf{Abstract:} Group 2 proposes to study the convergence
properties of simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and ant-colony approaches towards
finding optimal solutions for various travelling salesman problems.  Code will be tested
to find convergence rate, wall-clock time, and for solution space exploration.  For future studies,
we will consider looking at parallel and/or GPU solutions to accelerate algorithms.

\subsection{Go with the Winner Approaches}
Simulated annealing probabilistically convergences to the optimal solution at the rate
 of $\Omega{\frac{1}{n}}$ where n is the number of independent runs.  
Using heuristic schemes such as the ``Go with the Winner''~\cite{Aldous1994gwt}, hereby referred to as GWW, 
one can improve this convergence rate to $\Omega(log \frac{1}{n})$.  In general terms, GWW periodically assets
each independent simulated annealing run and determines if one is converging upon a losing solution.  Runs with 
no chance for success are immediately discarded while runs with the best chance of finding an optimal solution
are replicated; thus, GWW generates an ensemble of independent runs filled with  ``winners''.
