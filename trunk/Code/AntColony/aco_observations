Evap rate is a lot like cooling schedule in SA
beta is very important, but want integer powers for performance

larger number of ants helps pop out of a local minimum, especially with PheromoneBest

pheromoneBest gives convergence, but not always great solution - max/min. Good to have lots of ants.

try using pheromoneAS with high beta - best of both worlds

pheromoneAS behaves best without dynamicQ
pheromoneBest likes dynamicQ
